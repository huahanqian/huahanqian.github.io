Starting AtInf 5.x we have switched to use GitLink to help you easily step into AtInf code, 
without needing to do much configuration on your part.

In short GitLink patches PDB files, to look at the AtInf GitHub repository with a specific commit hash.
Stepping into AtInf code, it then fetches the exact code for that commit!
